The 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results

Description:

This dataset contains the cleaned results of the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, with free responses and personally identifying information removed for privacy. Included are three files:

survey_results_public.csv: Main survey results, with each row representing a respondent and each column an answer.
survey_results_schema.csv: Survey schema detailing the questions corresponding to each column name.
so_survey_2020.pdf: PDF of the survey instrument.
The survey was conducted from February 5 to February 28, 2020, with a median completion time of 16.6 minutes for qualified responses.

Respondents were primarily recruited through Stack Overflow's channels, including onsite messaging, blog posts, email lists, Meta posts, banner ads, and social media posts. As a result, highly engaged Stack Overflow users were more likely to participate. Respondents who completed the survey could opt-in for a "Census" badge as an incentive.
